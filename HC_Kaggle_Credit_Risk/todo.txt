TODO:
    
    write some overview
    Run a grid of parameters on xgb and evaluate the results # https://machinelearningmastery.com/xgboost-for-imbalanced-classification/
    [DONE] Remove overfitting from existing xgb model
    GIT this
    Add some method of predictors pre-selection - ridge regression?
    Build some simple model score that will be entering another model (like the riskiness of some of the categories)
    get WOEs into the logistic regression
    build stepwise logistic regression
    for logistic regression prepare correlation of predictors matrix
    add pipeline into processing
    switch data saving and processing to spark/parquet
    [DONE] add lift charts
    [DONE] add 1-average score vs. default rate chart with diagonal optimal line
    split modelling and evaluation notebooks
    explain the model with SHAPs
    try blackbox explainer
    try create separate models on each data set and then combine the pillars
    try lightGBM (from lightgbm import LGBMClassifier)
    try catBoost (from catboost import CatBoostClassifier)
    [DONE] split sample for boosting models to train/valid/test and tune it based on valid sample improvements
