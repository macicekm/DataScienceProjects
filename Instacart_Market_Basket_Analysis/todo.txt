Study the literature about market basket analysis

Search for discontinued products, as these customers wouldn't be able to purchase.
Check how to find out, whether customer is actually gonna place another order >> separate model? - predict NPD (next purchase day)

Create a model that generates the vector of probabilities of each product that will put into the basket.
Create a separate linear regression model, that predicts how many products is client likely to purchase.
Based on that, setup a threshold, sort products by probabilities, and set cutoff based on the linear regression model.
For the product target, select a TOP-N relevant products for recommendation based on frequency analysis.

Try some sequential method, by learning from previous to next purchase, not only from aggregation to final purchase
